# Old Style Digital Clock
A digital clock with no microcontrollers.

This is a simple design for a digital clock. Features:
- HH:MM 24-hour format.
- Based on common and readily available components like counters and logic gates.
- This clock uses a Pierce oscillator circuit (quartz crystal), so it will keep the time much more accurately than a NE555 or similar timers.
- Powered by 3 x AA 1.2 rechargeable batteries.
- Optional solar cell power arrangement.
